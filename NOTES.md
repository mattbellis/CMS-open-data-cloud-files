Data will be stored under Bellis' `mbellis@siena.edu` account on Google Cloud Storage. 

The *project* is called `CMS Open Data Samples`. 

We will have a *bucket* called `run-2`.

When we created it we took all of the defaults except that we selected fine-grained access. 

Enzo will have access to this bucket.
